## Design Patterns

Design patterns are repeatable solutions to commonly occuring problems in software design. Design patterns should not be confused with complete software designs that can be transformed into code. A design pattern is more like a template for solving a problem, and this template can be used in different situations. Design patterns should also not be confused with algorithms. Even though both describe solutions to problems, a design pattern is more high-level. The code of the same design pattern can be written differently in different programs.

Design patterns
-  help speed up the development process by providing tested and proven development paradigms (patterns). 
- help prevent subtle issues that may cause major problems
- improve code readability for coders who are familiar with the patterns
- provide general solutions that aren't tied to a specific problem
- allow developers to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions
    - We can describe the patterns using UML class diagrams

Design patterns are classified into 3 different types
- **Creational design patterns** - These patterns are concerned with class instantiation
- **Structural design patterns** - These patterns are concerned with class and object composition
- **Behavioral design patterns** - These patterns are concerned with the communication between objects.

The complete list of design patterns is very long and I will not be learnign them all. This repo will contain examples and explainations to the design patterns that I have either used before or are learning for use.
